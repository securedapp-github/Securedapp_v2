It includes various applications such as lending, borrowing, trading, and asset management. DeFi platforms operate on a decentralized network, offering transparency, accessibility, and financial inclusion.<br/><br/> DeFi services are decentralized applications (dApps) that utilize the decentralized nature of public blockchains and the power of smart contracts to offer globally accessible financial services."
