It's different from Web 2.0, where a handful of big companies call the shots. <br/><br/> Instead, Web3 works on shared records that are more transparent. As more parts of Web 3.0 come into play, a shift is expected to usher in an era where the use and access of the internet are governed by community-run networks, rather than centralized entities."
