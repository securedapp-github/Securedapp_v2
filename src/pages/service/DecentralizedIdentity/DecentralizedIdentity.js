            "Decentralized identity is a method for identifying and authenticating users and entities without relying on a central authority. Traditional identity management verifies individuals through attributes like name, Social Security number, birth date, or email address, whereas decentralized identity leverages blockchain and other decentralized technologies. This approach minimizes the risk of data breaches by avoiding the concentration of sensitive information in a single, vulnerable location, thus enhancing overall security."
