      q: "How Decentralized Identity Work?",
      a: "DID works through the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs). DIDs are cryptographically secure, user-created identifiers that are not tied to any central organization. VCs are digital proofs of identity attributes that can be verified using blockchain technology, allowing users to present their credentials without revealing unnecessary personal information.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can DID be integrated with existing systems?",
      a: "Yes, our DID solutions are designed to be compatible with existing systems and can be seamlessly integrated into your current infrastructure.",
    },
    {
      q: "What are different DID use cases?",
      a: "DID is versatile and can benefit various use cases, including secure online authentication, identity verification for financial services, and access control for digital and physical assets.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does SecureDApp support clients with DID implementation?",
      a: "SecureDApp provides comprehensive support throughout the entire DID implementation process. From initial consultation and design to deployment and ongoing maintenance, our expert team is dedicated to ensuring a successful and efficient integration of DID solutions into your organization.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the future of DID technology?",
      a: "The future of DID technology is promising, with growing adoption and advancements in blockchain identity. As decentralized identity solutions continue to evolve, they are expected to play a key role in enhancing digital security, privacy, and user control across various applications.",
